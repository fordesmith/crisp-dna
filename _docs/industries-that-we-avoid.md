Industries that we avoid
========================

In theory we avoid the arms industry and the surveillance industry, and some others on a case-by-case basis. That's really not much of a problem in Australia because we don\`t really have those industries on any scale![]()

Why avoid industries?
------------------------------------------

Our two [core values](what-is-syncopate.html) "Freedom" and "Heart over Wallet" can sometimes collide. For example when it comes to which industries we work in. Some Crispers feel very strongly against the arms industry and the surveillance industry - for them, "Heart over Wallet" means avoiding those industries even if it means a loss of profit, and they don't want to associate with a consulting company that works with these industries.

On the other hand, our "Freedom" principle means that people can work with whatever they want, and some of us have no moral qualms with these industries.

So what gives?

To maintain a [happy home](what-is-syncopate.html) with mutual respect, we've agreed on this compromise:

1.  Syncopate doesn't work with industries that at least one Syncopater has a strong opinion against (currently Arms and Surveillance).
2.  If someone really wants to take on such a client, they must do so outside of Syncopate.

How do we decide blacklists?
--------------------------------------------------

If you are *strongly* against any specific industry, bring it up (or better yet, before joining). The decision boils down to how strong your feelings are for that industry vs how much others love it :o)

A useful mental model is for each person to classify that industry:

-   **Green:** “I love that industry, and I would be really upset if I’m not allowed to work with that”
-   **Grey:** “I'm OK with that industry, but if someone has a very strong opinion against, I’m OK with avoiding it.
-   **Black:** "It’s not OK for me to work with that industry. I think it will contaminate our brand, and I'd rather leave in that case."

If an industry is on your Black list, and it isn't on anyone else's Green list, then we add it to the list of industries to avoid.

The only problem we have is if the industry is Green for one person and Black for someone else. That's never happened so far though. The industries that are Black to some people have always been Grey for everyone else (and therefore OK to blacklist).

Can I work in these?
-------------------------------------------------------

Through us, no. Outside, it’s up to the consultant. But no Syncopate material is allowed to be used in that assignment, no connection to the brand at all. The consultant needs to take that through their own company. "Off the record" so to speak.

What if really I want to?
-----------------------------------------------------

If you are a new candidate and one of our blacklisted industries is Green for you, then this probably isn't the right place for you.

If you are a Syncopater already, you have some options:

-   **Option 1:** Convince the existing Blacks (people who hate that industry) to change to Gray.
-   **Option 2:** Adapt your stance. Change your own Green to Gray, and accept that the industry is blacklisted.
-   **Option 3:** Leave.
