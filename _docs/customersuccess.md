To stay competitive, leading firms need to do **difficult things**
--------------

Delivering benefits from transformation programs is difficult. There are many reasons why most financial services transformation programs are not transformational at all. This narrative isn't new. However, there isn’t a lot of evidence to suggest the approach is changing.

For one, many transformation programs [don't start with fundamental principles in mind](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reasons-your-transformation-isnt-forde-smith%3FtrackingId=7SfokilfSQylWFCFnlrBeg%253D%253D/?trackingId=7SfokilfSQylWFCFnlrBeg%3D%3D). 

Secondly, the ability to **extract benefits** is often lacking, resulting in a lot of activity and a lot of spend, but few meaningful results. 

<br>

That’s why we created our **Customer Success** assessment
--------------

It is based on seven factors that determine whether your transformation will deliver value, or not. 

It’s an online assessment now assisted by AI summaries and recommendations.

We’ve refined it over 10 years.

How you use the **Customer Success** assessment
--------------


a. [Please contact us](mailto:info@syncopate.com.au) (info@syncopate.com.au) take you through the assessment and example results. [A demo survey can be found here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HFK2RTZ).

b. We configure the survey for your organisation. Typically we capture results from different cohorts (e.g. executives, delivery managers, team members, line managers) to expose differences of opinions. e.g. Executives might think the program is going well, however those in the trenches harbour concerns that they cannot otherwise communicate. 

c. You run the survey periodically (e.g. every three to 6 months). We can automate the AI to provide summaries of key concerns for each factor for different cohorts. 

d. If you need help, we can assist run and present on the results and recommendations.
