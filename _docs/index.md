What is Syncopate?
==================

Syncopate is a consulting company based in Sydney, Australia. Formally, Syncopate doesn't really have a business area. Nothing about our model is specific to any domain or industry.

In practice though, because of our history and the people who happen to work at Syncopate, we're primarily interested in the following business areas:

1.  **New product development, especially in Financial Services**. Either shorter or longer engagements.
2.  **Agile/Lean/Design Thinking coaching and training**. Mostly shorter engagements or part-time.
3.  **Large project or business set up and delivery (using agile etc)**. Mostly longer engagements and close to full-time.

But we aren't a very typical consulting company. For example:

-   None of the consultants are actually employed by us
-   We have no managers, not even a CEO. Instead we rely on self-organisation and transparency. Almost everything is bottom-up, and [anyone can drive any decision](decisions.html).
-   Syncopate's main purpose is to enable consultants to be happy, and [Happiness Index](happiness-index.html) is our driving metric. Strong revenue and delighted customers are a side effect, not a goal.
-   Syncopate doesn't want to earn money from it's consultants. It is in practice a non-profit company (although not formally so). Consultants [keep most of what they earn](economic-model.html).
-   Our [ownership model](ownership-model.html) is designed to keep our stock financially worthless. There is no incentive to "cash in".
-   Consultants are 100% autonomous. They can do whatever they want (as long as they don't hurt the brand or [our house](what-is-syncopate.html)), and work as much or as little as they want.
