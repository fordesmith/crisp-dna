To stay competitive, Financial Services firms need to do **difficult things**.
==============

Delivering benefits from transformation programs is difficult.There are many reasons why most financial services transformation programs are not transformational at all. This narrative isn't new. However, there isn’t a lot of evidence to suggest the approach is changing.

That’s why we created our **Benefit Delivery** assessment.
==============

It’s an online assessment now assisted by AI summaries and recommendations.

It is based on seven factors that determine whether your transformation will deliver value, or not. 

We’ve refined it over 10 years.

The Seven **Success Factors**
==============

1.    Commitment to a compelling vision
2.    Aligned change leadership and capability
3.    Disciplined execution
4.    Communication & engagement
5.    Ways of working
6.    Knowledge and skills
7.    Strategic benefit management
