To stay competitive, Financial Services firms need to do **difficult things**
==============

Delivering benefits from transformation programs is difficult.There are many reasons why most financial services transformation programs are not transformational at all. This narrative isn't new. However, there isn’t a lot of evidence to suggest the approach is changing.



That’s why we created our **Benefit Delivery** assessment
==============

It is based on seven factors that determine whether your transformation will deliver value, or not. 

It’s an online assessment now assisted by AI summaries and recommendations.

We’ve refined it over 10 years.
